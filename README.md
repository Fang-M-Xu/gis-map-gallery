‚ú≥Ô∏è Looking for the **NYC Housing Price Forecasting (AI + GIS)** case? It now lives in a dedicated repo: `Fang-M-Xu/gis-housing-forecast`.

------

## Highlights

- **See spatial patterns at a glance**: Heat/Density maps surface hotspots for site selection, public safety, and risk.
- **Business‚Äëfirst cartography**: Store networks, routing plans, and thematic maps aligned to commercial and public‚Äësector needs.
- **Professional map craftsmanship**: Built in ArcGIS Pro; consistent palette, legends, scale bars, and labeling.

## Map Gallery (Static/Thematic)

- **Point Map**: Clear visibility into store/facility footprint; ideal for network strategy and placement.
- **Heat/Density**: Identify hotspots and spatial clustering of people or events.
- **Route/Flow**: Connect attractions; optimize paths for experience and efficiency.
- **Thematic**: Research‚Äëgrade overlays (terrain, hydrology, climate) for deep‚Äëdive analysis.

üëâ Each category includes **design rationale, styling parameters, export specs, sample deliverables**.
